# Statistical modeling in exporing complete genomes

Tatiana Lenskaia, Shrivardhan Bharadwaj, and Daniel Boley

This repository contains the core methods for exploring complete genomes without losses.
We utilize a set-theory perspective on a genome as a set of sets of string of fixed length.
We have developed dictionary-based methods and implemented them in Python. 
These methods allow to adjust sensitivity and speceficity by varying string length
for analyzing genome organization and interaction between genomes.
